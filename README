A simple tool for playing with combinatorial logic. 

The main feature is going to be a module for generating functions that adhere to a given specification. 
This is going to be usefull for some logic puzzles from the book 'To mock a mockingbird' by R.Smullyan.

Example. Having only B (where B x y z = x (y z)) build a combinator C that satisfies
  C x y z w = x y (z w).

The program will try to find such C.
